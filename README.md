# Next.js 15 Server Components: Dynamic Imports in Loops

This repository demonstrates a potential issue and its solution when using dynamic imports within loops in Next.js 15 server components.  The issue involves inconsistent rendering behavior due to the concurrent nature of dynamic imports within the loop.

## Issue

The original `dynamic-imports.js` file shows how concurrent dynamic imports inside a loop can cause unexpected behavior in rendering server components. Components may not render in the expected order or may fail to render altogether.

## Solution

The `dynamic-imports-solution.js` file provides a solution using `Promise.all` to ensure all imports resolve before rendering. This avoids potential ordering inconsistencies.   A more robust and scalable method, for large-scale applications, would involve more sophisticated dependency management and data-fetching strategies.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Run `npm install`.
3.  Run `npm run dev`.
